# What is MonsterJS

MonsterJS is a JavaScript framework for building web applications.
It is based on web components which is good for encapsulating components and building micro frontend apps.
This framework is not using virtual DOM, instead it will create a watcher for each binding and update it only when necessary.
This feature is what makes it fast and have a good client run-time performance and memory efficient for large applications.
