# What is MonsterJS

MonsterJS is a JavaScript framework for building web applications or stand-alone components.
It is based on web components suitable for encapsulating components and building micro frontend apps.

This framework is not using virtual DOM, instead, it will create a watcher for each binding and update it only when necessary.
This feature is what makes it fast and has a good client run-time performance and memory efficiency for large applications.

Official docs [https://monster-js.org](https://monster-js.org).

## MonsterJS in other frameworks

MonsterJS works perfectly in the other frameworks.
Its components are all web components so it can easily be integrated into Angular, Vue, React, and other javascript frameworks.
It can even work on vanilla javascript applications.

Developing widgets, stand-alone components, and micro frontend architecture is made easy using this framework.
